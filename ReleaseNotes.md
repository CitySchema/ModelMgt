The 3.0.0 Release has many simplifications in the Tasks and a few changes that make it easier to do automated processing of large batched of new models.

The tasks in the Import Edit Inspect and Enroll Models have been re-organized so that Model Attributes can be set for models while they are in the Prep_MP feature class. Previously, these attributes were set within the Import Models task. The Assign Model Attributes task also sets the attribute for Model_Batch to the name of the folder that holds the Batch_GDB.

The Promote and Demote Models task group (formerly named "Stage Changes" has new and revised tasks that facilitate the automated flagging of Promotion and Demotion Candidates which are designeted through the QA_Flag field. The tools for this automated flagging are saved in the toolbox associated with the model batch. 

In this newly documented bulk promo/demo procedure, the curator adjusts the candidate flags as necessary based on the observed collisions between new an existing models or other status changes. 

The QA_Flag provides a very handy way of highlighting, and un-flagging candidates through a pair of definition query layers that provide instant feedback. 

New QA Flag Domains:
The new Promo/Demo Candidate flags have been added to the default domains. To see these new values, you may need to update geodatabases in your current Stage feature classes.
